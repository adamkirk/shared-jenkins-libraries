usage: `checkoutWithTags()`

arguments: nil

Summary:

Provides an alternative to the default `checkout scm` in jenkins pipelines.
The default behaviour is to checkout the branch without any tags. This 
causes issues when defining build artifact names. They should use the tag,
but can't without them being fetched in git.

This should be used in any case where tags are a necessity for the success
of the pipeline.

This issue highlights the need for this script:
